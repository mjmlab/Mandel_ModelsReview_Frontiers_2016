# Abstract

Animals are colonized by bacteria, and in many cases partners have co-evolved to perform mutually beneficial functions. An exciting and ongoing legacy of the past decade has been an expansion of technology to enable study of natural associations *in situ* (*in vivo*). As a result more symbioses are being examined, and additional details are being revealed for well-studied systems with a focus on the interactions between partners in the native context. With this framing, we review recent literature from the *Vibrio fischeri*-*Euprymna scolopes* symbiosis and focus on key studies that have had an impact on understanding bacteria-animal interactions broadly. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the system, but rather to focus on particular studies that have excelled at moving from pattern to process in facilitating an understanding of the molecular basis to intriguing observations in the field. Here we discuss processes regulating strain and species specificity; bacterial signaling to host morphogenesis; multiple roles for nitric oxide; flagellar motility and chemotaxis; and efforts to understand unannotated and poorly annotated genes. Overall these studies demonstrate how functional approaches *in vivo* in a tractable system have provided valuable insight into general principles of microbe-host interactions.

# Introduction

Studies of human, animal, and plant microbiomes have been enabled by novel culture-independent approaches and technological advancements in DNA sequencing. In recent years a prominent role for microbial communities of the gut, skin, and other organs has emerged as modulators of human health [@humanmicrobiomeprojectconsortium2012]. These studies followed from influential animal studies in systems that are yielding critical insight into microbiome assembly, stability, communication, and evolution [@ruby2008, @mcfall-ngai2013]. The focus of this review is to examine one model system and to examine how key findings in that system have enabled an increasingly higher resolution of the processes and principles that underlie microbe-host communication.

When Hawaiian bobtail squid hatch from their eggs, they are exposed to millions of microbes in each milliliter of seawater. Although *V. fischeri* make up less than 1 in 5,000 of these planktonic, environmental bacteria, the "light organ" of the hatchling squid becomes colonized exclusively with *V. fischeri* [@ruby1998, @mandel2010]. The microbe-host specificity relies on a series of reciprocal communications between microbe and host, many of which are detailed in the sections below. Over the course of 48 hours the bacteria establish a mature colonization in the squid crypts and, at high cell density, produce light as a result of quorum-sensing. The bacterial bioluminescence is reflected by host tissue to camouflage the shadow or silhouette that the noctural-foraging squid would cast in the moonlight, thus protecting the host in a process termed counterillumination [@ruby1992, @jones2004]. Initiation of colonization occurs only in newly-hatched squid, seeding an individual host's crypts for its lifetime. The bacteria produce light at night, then at dawn approximately 90-95% of the symbiotic population is expelled into the seawater. The remaining cells grow up during the day, produce light at night, and a diel cycle proceeds [@wier2010]. Host cellular changes accompany this cycle, for example with a daily reshaping of the epithelial brush border against which the bacteria reside during the final two hours prior to the daily expulsion/venting [@wier2010].

As an environmentally-transmitted symbiosis, the *Vibrio*-squid model has a number of valuable characteristics that have served it well as a study system for identifying molecular mechanisms. First, the binary system has only two partners and is therefore naturally reduced. Second, both partners can be raised separately and then introduced for experimentation. Third, *V. fischeri* is genetically tractable, and unbiased mutagenesis as well as precise genetic alterations can be introduced with relative ease. Fourth, the bacteria colonize the host light organ directly under the semi-transparent mantle and funnel; dissection of these tissues in anesthetized animals permits imaging of the site of infection and direct analysis of bacterial behaviors and host responses. Fifth, synchronous colonization of hatchling has permitted developmental staging of the colonization process. For most of the processes described below, many of these benefits were important in the advances describes.

# From pattern to process in the *Vibrio*-squid system

In each section below, we highlight key discoveries in the *Vibrio*-squid symbiosis with a specific focus on how this model system has revealed processes that are important broadly in bacterial colonization.

## Going steady

*E. scolopes* squid are colonized only by *V. fischeri*, and this exclusivity has guided substantial inquiry and discovery in the system. This pattern was first noted by McFall-Ngai and Ruby [@mcfall-ngai1991] and extended in subsequent works [@ruby1998, @mandel2009]. The ability to image the live animal during colonization enabled the discovery of *V. fischeri* aggregating in close proximity to the ciliated epithelial fields of the light organ [@nyholm2000]. Nyholm discovered that a narrow distance between the green fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria and the squid epithelial tissue was the result of host-produced mucus, which included *N*-acetylneuraminic acid and *N*-acetylgalactosamine. Recent work has demonstrated that *V. fischeri* bind to cilia within this mucus field [@altura2013]. Whereas many bacteria can bind in host mucus, only specific strains and species exhibit a competitive dominance over non-colonizing isolates, only (some) *V. fischeri* strains proceed to fully initiate colonization [@nyholm2000, @nyholm2003, @mandel2009].

Around this same time, the genetic basis for bacterial aggregation was being discovered and characterized in the laboratory of Karen Visick. A forward genetic screen for colonization factors first identified an orphan histidine kinase, RscS (regulator of symbiotic colonization-sensor), but without a phenotype or target it was difficult to know how this factor connected to the colonization process [@visick2001]. The same screen identified an eighteen gene locus that encoded regulatory proteins, glycosyltransferases, and other factors involved in exopolysaccharide production and export. Mutations in this region, the *syp* locus (symbiosis polysaccharide), conferred dramatic colonization defects in the animal as well as defects in biofilm formation in culture [@yip2005]. A connection between the earlier study was discovered when it was shown that RscS regulates expression of the *syp* locus [@yip2006]. Overexpression of RscS provided a valuable tool in which bacterial colony formation took on a wrinkled or rugose colony morphology that is typical of biofilm-forming cells in a colony [@yip2006]. Phenotypes of *rscS* and *syp* alleles in colony-based biofilm assays map closely to their phenotypes during squid colonization, providing a valuable experimental tool for discovery and characterization of biofilm regulation. Further work has identified multiple layers of regulation, including a negative regultory pathway that includes SypE and SypA, putative matrix proteins that integrate with the polysaccharide matrix, and a unique phosphorelay pathway [@visick2009, @morris2013, @norsworthy2015, @ray2015].

The genetic approaches described above (and in most studies in this review) were conducted in strain ES114, a squid isolate from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, that is used widely as a canonical squid symbiont. In addition to the biofilm regulatory pathway, a number of approaches including forward and reverse genetics studies had identified factors that were important for squid colonization [@stabb2013]. However, only some *V. fischeri* strains can colonize squid. Therefore, to examine the genetic basis for this host colonization specificity, Mandel and colleagues conducted a comparative genomic analysis of strains ES114 and MJ11, the latter being a fish symbiont that does not colonize squid robustly [@mandel2009]. The study determined that 91 % of ES114 genes were almost identical between the squid and fish symbiont, but that approximately 400 genes were unique to each strain. Analysis of these factors revealed that the squid biofilm regulator, RscS, was encoded in the squid symbiont but not in the fish symbiont. The known RscS target genes, *sypA, sypB, ..., sypR* were encoded in both genomes and fairly conserved (>85 % amino acid identity). It was known previously that ES114 mutants that lacked RscS were unable to productively colonize the squid [@visick2001]. Therefore, the study asked whether the absence of the regulator could explain the differential colonization phenotype. Introduction of RscS into strain MJ11 was sufficient to allow it to colonize the squid host. Phylogenetic analyses supported a model in which MJ11 was part of an ancestral group of *V. fischeri* that lacked *rscS*, and that this gene was acquired coincident with squid colonization of squid in the North Pacific Ocean (i.e., Japan and Hawaii).

A single gene that was sufficient to shift the animal hosts available to a bacterium was extreme but consistent with an emerging literature that individual loci could impact microbe-host specificity. Work in entomopathogenic nematodes had shown that symbiotic *Xenorhabdus nematophila* requires the three-gene *nilABC* locus for colonization, and that expression of these factors in a heterologous symbiont is sufficient to enable colonization of *Steinernema carpocapsae*, the worm host that otherwise is specific for *X. nematophila* [@cowles2008]. Small genetic changes in *Yersinia pestis* have been key to its ability to colonize new niches, including single gene acquisitions and even inactivation of a gene already present [@sun2008, @sun2014, @zimbler2015]. In the human gut microbiome there are examples in which single gene changes have been critical; e.g., in *Bacteroides fragilis* polysaccharide A (PSA) confers a key immunomodulatory benefit that cannot be obtained from the other seven capsular polysaccharides produced [@mazmanian2008].

Studies on host colonization specificity in general and biofilm formation in particular have highlighted many of the strengths of the model and revealed collaboration among multiple research groups. Imaging *in situ* was key to the initial discovery of the aggregates, forward genetics identified core exopolysaccharide synthetic and regulatory components, comparative genomics revealed the role of this pathway in the evolution and specificity of the association, and high-throughput genetic approaches are identifying additional levels of regulation. Additionally, this work highlights the value of model systems of beneficial bacteria, including *Vibrio* and *Xenorhabdus* models, to identify mechanistic details that resonate in beneficial and pathogenic colonization models.

## Giving up some of myself to let you know I'm here

*E. scolopes* squid provide a particularly dramatic example of a role for bacteria influencing a specific host developmental process. Development of the host tissue proceeds on different trajectories depending on whether the specific symbiont *V. fischeri* is present; only once the symbiont has colonized, the ciliated appendages of the host light organ undergo apoptosis, hemocyte infiltration, and tissue regression during the subsequent five days [@mcfall-ngai1991, @montgomery1994]. The host morphogenesis is dramatic, with appendages that begin as outstretched mucus factories to recruit colonizing bacteria being reduced to small stumps [@montgomery1994]. As a result, it seems that initiation of the symbiosis is restricted to the first few days of the animal's life while the appendages are present and secreting mucus.

How does the host know that the bacteria are inside to appropriately time the regression? It turns out that *V. fischeri* sheds envelope components that are received by receptors on the host. In particular, the bacterial peptidoglycan fragment, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), which previously had been shown to induce a damaging apoptosis in ciliated epithelia upon release from *Bordetella pertussis*, was identified to perform a similar function in *V. fischeri*, but this time with a resulting beneficial outcome [@koropatnick2004]. The Lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is required in conjuction with TCT to recapitulate the apoptosis phenotype observed when intact *V. fischeri* are presented to the host. The cell death from these compounds, in conjunction with hemocyte trafficking that is also induced from TCT, results in the regression phenotype. Previously these compounds had been associated only with pathogenic associations, but this work underscored a remarkable conservation to the cell biology of microbial-host interactions, emphasizing the context of the interaction to understand the fitness effects on the partners involved [@koropatnick2004].

Once the bacteria announce their arrival, how does the host speak back? In addition to regression of the appendages that recruit the bacteria there are additional mechanisms by which the host receives and likely modulates the bacterial signal. Host nitric oxide production, described in more detail below, is diminished as a result of bacterial signaling (synergistically with LPS) [@altura2011]. The host produces a peptidoglycan recognition protein, EsPGRP2, which is secreted into the crypts containing bacteria, and that has the ability to degrade TCT [@troll2010]. Additionally, there are data to suggest that host alkaline phosphatase, EsAP, modifies Lipid A after the initial signaling [@rader2012]. In each case the host response is to diminish the potency of the bacterial products, but only after they have exerted their influence on host development.

This work in *V. fischeri* was influenced by studies in invertebrate systems that demonstrated host development in response to symbiont colonization and in vertebrates that showed general responses to consortia (reviewed in [@montgomery1994]), and itself has influenced a field in which bacterial products play important roles in animal development. An early mammalian example by Hooper and Gordon demonstrated that in response to colonization by gut *Bacteroidetes* such as *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*, terminal tissue differentiation (e.g., fucosylation) is dependent on the presence of the symbiotic bacteria [@hooper2001a]. There now exist many examples of bacteria directing specific host development. Recent exciting examples include *Algoriphagus machipongonensis* sulfonolipid signaling for multicellular rosette development in the choanoflagellate *Salpingoeca rosetta*, and *Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea* phage tail-like structures that stimulate tubeworm metamorphosis [@alegado2012, @shikuma2014].

## NO way in

There is a long history of the study of NO in eukaryotes, and this small diffusible molecule has been implicated in many different cellular processes including signaling and innate immunity [@fang2004]. Although the roles for NO in eukaryotic physiology and defense against pathogens was discovered many years ago, through the study of the squid-vibrio and other symbioses [@damiani2016] it has become apparent that NO also influences the establishment and maintenance of mutualistic host-microbe relationships as both a signal and a specificity determinant [@wang2011].

A key study revealing a role for NO in animal-microbe symbioses was published by Davidson, et al. [@davidson2004]. In this work the authors demonstrated that during the initiation of colonization in the squid-vibrio system, NO is produced in host tissue through the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and this activity was attenuated after successful colonization by *V. fischeri*. Using staining and immunocytochemistry NOS and NO were found located in the epithelium of the light organ, as well as in vesicles within mucus shed from these cells. It is within this mucus that the bacterial cells aggregate prior to entering the light organ. Treatment of the animals with a NO scavenger allowed large aggregates of non-symbiotic vibrios to form, but these bacteria did not go on to colonize. However, in the absence of a NO scavenger *V. fischeri* aggregated in the mucus, went on to colonize, and after colonization NOS activity and NO production were attenuated. The results strongly suggested that NO acts as a specificity determinant, helping to limit aggregation of non-symbiotic vibrios and select for symbiotically competent *V. fischeri* from the mixed microbial population found in seawater. Of course these results also suggested that *V. fischeri* would need to effectively sense and respond to the host-produced NO to successfully establish the partnership.

Since this initial report, progress has been made in determining how *V. fischeri* senses and responds to NO. In 2010, Wang et al. described a role for the NO-detoxifying enzyme flavohenoglobin (Hmp) in the protection of V. fischeri from NO during host colonization [@poole2000, @wang2010]. Using genetic approaches it was demonstrated that a strain lacking hmp displayed a colonization deficiency. Although it had been previously predicted using bioinformatic analyses [@rodionov2005], in this study expression of hmp was linked to the activity of a NO-responsive negative regulator NsrR [@tucker2010]. However, NsrR is not the only important NO-sensing regulator in *V. fischeri*. H-NOX, a heme NO/oxygen-binding protein also plays a role in symbiotically relevant NO-responsive regulation of genes in *V. fischeri* [@@wang2010a]. Although H-NOX-like proteins are widely distributed in bacteria, this was the first report describing bacterial H-NOX function. Interestingly, it appears that one role for H-NOX in *V. fischeri* is to sense NO and correspondingly suppress bacterial hemin uptake during the early stages of host colonization. The authors predicted that early repression of iron uptake would protect the cells from the potentially harmful effects of Fenton chemistry while exposed to host-generated oxidants. This repression would then be relieved upon bacterial-influenced attenuation of oxidant production, and hemin uptake genes would be expressed to support growth in the iron-limited light organ environment [@davidson2004, @graf2000]. A subsequent study demonstrated that the hemin uptake genes in *V. fischeri* are induced during the later stages of symbiotic colonization and deletion of these genes negatively impacted colonization [@septer2011]. Together these results demonstrate that although the ability to sense and detoxify NO is important in terms of symbiotic specificity, NO also acts as a signal to modulate bacterial gene expression to promote successful colonization.

Although these studies have led to a better understanding of the role of a few key proteins and regulators in the response of *V. fischeri* to NO and the initial stages of the symbiosis, there is much yet to be learned about the global effects of NO on *V. fischeri* gene expression and metabolism, how this molecule acts as a specificity determinant, and whether there is a role for NO in the mature symbiosis. For example, the work of Wier et al. has suggested that NO may play a role in the daily symbiotic rhythm in adult animal [@wier2010]. Their data predicted that nitrate/nitrite respiration is used by the bacterial symbionts throughout the daylight hours. Similarly to Escherichia coli [@vine2011], NO appears to be produced by *V. fischeri* during respiration of nitrate/nitrite in laboratory culture (A.K. Dunn, unpublished data). These levels of NO induce alternative respiratory pathways that likely influence the physiology and metabolism of the bacterium [@dunn2010]. Together these separate lines of evidence suggest that NO may play a role beyond signaling and selection in the initiation of the symbiotic relationship. In the future it will be exciting to combine studies of NO and the bacterial NO response with the more recently developed ability to rear squid to adulthood ([@koch2013], see above section on light).

The value of further studies of NO in the squid-vibrio system lie not only in providing important information about the role of this molecule in beneficial host-microbe interactions, but also for comparative studies to host-pathogen responses. From our current understanding, although the outcome of the relationships is very different, it appears that although NO is being produced by the host and sensed by the bacteria in similar ways in both types of interactions (Wang and Ruby 2011; PMID 21338463; Fang 2004, PMID 15378046). The more we learn about the intricacies of the NO response in these disparate systems, the better able we will be to understand how microbes influence host health in both positive and negative ways. (this is a little lame, but I ran out of steam for big-picture).

## Swimming against the flow

In the mucus field that serves as the entry point for bacteria heading into the host, colonizing bacteria enter at one of three pores on either side of the bilaterally symmetrical light organ. The squid sheds mucus from the pores at the same time that *V. fischeri* aggregates in the mucus and migrates to the pores, and enters through one of them. This situation presents a number of questions about bacterial transit in a dynamic mucociliary field, including how the bacteria balance adhesion and migration; what forces control bacterial aggregation in the host environment; how the bacteria travel against this flow to enter the host; and whether the same processes in the mucus field are required in the host ducts and crypts.

How do colonizing bacteria travel against this powerful flow? A key study identifying a role for flagellar motility was conducted over twenty years ago [@ruby1993]. In that work Ruby and Asato confirmed that planktonic *V. fischeri* were motile due to a polar tuft of sheathed flagella. However, by 24 hours post inoculation most cells in the light organ crypts were non-flagellated. Upon expulsion of bacteria from the host, the bacteria regrow their flagella in 45-60 min even in nutrient-deplete seawater [@ruby1993]. Therefore the bacterial life cycle alternates between a motile planktonic lifestyle and a non-flagellated crypt-colonized state.

Significant details have since been elucidated about the molecular mechanisms that control flagellar development in *V. fischeri*, which in turn has solidified the importance of swimming motility for squid colonization. Random transposon mutagenesis provided evidence that nonmotile mutants could not colonize [@graf1994], and reverse genetics revealed that mutants defective for flagellar motility or chemotaxis did not establish productive colonization with the squid host [@millikan2003, @millikan2004, @deloney-marino2012]. Together these studies established a model of a hierarchy of flagellar gene expression in *V. fischeri* controlled by the σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent regulator FlrA. There is evidence for regulation by quorum sensing and by magnesium, and other sensory inputs are likely [@oshea2005, @cao2012].

Bacterial flagellar motility often occurs in a directed fashion in which rotation of the flagellar bundle results in net movement toward preferred nutrient sources. Given the above information that chemotaxis was required for colonization, it seemed likely that the bacteria were swimming toward a host compound. The first evidence for chitin oligosaccharides as the specific attractant was raised when addition of exogenous chitobiose, the *N*-acetylglucosamine dimer, blocked colonization. The monomer did not have such an effect [@mandel2012]. Given that *N*-acetylglucosamine is abundant on eukaryotic cell surfaces, yet chitin and its breakdown oligosaccharides are more specialized in their localization, it seemed possible that this could be a specific cue for the host crypts. Mutants defective for chemotaxis arrested at the outer face of the light organ pore, the same stage at which wild-type *V. fischeri* arrested in the presence of added chitin oligosaccharides [@mandel2012]. These results strongly suggested that a host source of chitin was a signal for the bacteria to enter the pore. Direct imaging revealed the presence of insoluble chitin bound to hemocytes within the host [@mandel2012, @heath-heckman2011], which may be released through the action of a host endochitinase [@kremer2013]. Together, this illustrates a specific colonization checkpoint that is regulated by both host and symbiont factors.

Work on bacterial motility at the host interface has provided a valuable toolset to probe mechanisms of symbiosis and reveal novel signaling pathways. Many environmental strains have dozens of genes that encode chemotactic sensory proteins, the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). The 43 proteins in *V. fischeri* is typical in this regard, and despite difficulties in studying a large protein family, functions have now been assigned to three of these proteins. VfcA is the major amino acid chemoreceptor, and VfcB and VfcB2 are fatty acid chemoreceptors [@brennan2013, @nikolakakis2016]. In addition to providing information directly about colonization, these tools have provided insight into the role of LPS during colonization and for the evolution and the generation of torque at the flagellar motor [@post2012, @beeby2016]. Furthermore, recent work has suggested that the rotation of the flagella--which is enclosed in an LPS sheath--triggers the host immune response by promoting LPS release [@brennan2014].

Satisfying answers to some of these questions are beginning to be addressed, including a role for cilia in modulating adhesion, and chemotaxis toward host-produced and host-cleaved chitin modulating a key developmental checkpoint. Still, important questions remain that suggest novel and interesting biology to be revealed through the symbiosis. Open questions include how bacteria transit through the mucus in a flagellar-independent manner; the molecular basis of chitin oligosaccharide sensing in the symbiont; and the processes that regulate the developmental switch between the aflagellate state in the host versus the swimming state in seawater.

## Light up my life

An important aspect to mutualistic symbioses is the selection of appropriate and cooperative partners. In theory, these relationships could be exploited by partners that are less cooperative (i.e. "cheaters") [@ghoul2014]. For example, in both the rhizobium-leguminous plant [@kiers2003] and *Vibrio*-squid symbioses the microbial partners provide costly services to their hosts (nitrogen fixation and light production respectively). However, it is rare to find bacterial symbionts associated with the hosts that do not provide these services ("cheaters"). The *Vibrio*-squid mutualism provides an excellent model system for studying cooperative partner selection, and studies to date indicate that bacterial light production is required for bacterial cells to persist in the light organ.

In 2000, Visick et al. reported a key role for luminescence in the development of the *Vibrio*-squid symbiosis and persistence of the bacterial symbiont. Specifically, this study demonstrated a direct role of luciferase (the enzyme that produces light) in the induction of host development and bacterial symbiotic persistence [@visick2000]. Prior to this report, although it was known that bacteria produced light during the symbiosis, the significance of bioluminescence in the symbiosis was not clear. By testing colonization ability of strains with mutations either in a structural luminescence gene or luminescence regulatory genes, it was discovered that these mutant strains colonized juvenile squid to the same levels as wild type in the first 24 hours. However, by 48 hours there was a three- to four-fold reduction in colonization by the dark mutants as compared to wild type. In addition, levels of the mutant strains also decreased in squid co-colonized with a luminescence mutant and wild type, indicating the presence of light-producing wild-type cells in the light organ could not complement the colonization defect of the light-deficient cells. These results suggested that the ability for the bacteria to produce light was important for persistence in the light organ and that somehow the non-luminescent cells are selected against during development of the symbiosis.

Interestingly, the light-deficient strains had a specific effect on host development. Although colonization by a luminescence mutant still triggered apoptosis-related developmental changes in the ciliated surface of the light organ, colonization of the tissue by these strains no longer increased cell swelling of the epithelial cells lining the light organ crypt spaces. Therefore, light production appeared to play a specific role in host developmental pathways. Notably, this was the first report of *V. fischeri* genes required for induction of bacterial-triggered differentiation of host tissue.

It was later discovered that the antibiotic markers and method for constructing the mutants used by Visick et al. [@visick2000] resulted in colonization attenuation and pleiotropic effects. To further confirm the role of light production in symbiotic colonization, Bose et al. [@bose2008] took advantage of newly developed tools to construct strains lacking the luminescence structural genes, as well as strains where expression of the luminescence structural genes was uncoupled from normal cell regulatory pathways. Using these strains, the results of Visick et al were confirmed, demonstrating that the strain lacking the luminescence structural genes displayed a four-fold reduction in colonization as compared to wild type. However, these studies were limited to the early stages of colonization due to the difficulty of raising juvenile animals to adulthood. Previous studies had suggested that maintenance of the symbiosis over the life of the animal requires a maturation process of several weeks [@montgomery1998], leaving the question of how production of light influences symbiosis maturation beyond 72 hours.

A major breakthrough for the field came with the development of modified protocols for simplified rearing of newly-hatched juvenile squid through and beyond the maturation process. These methods allowed investigation of how bacterial-produced light affects the development of the symbiosis over four weeks [@koch2013]. In these studies, the levels of the luminescence-deficient mutant associated with the squid light organ continued to decrease over time, reaching the level of detection after 28 days. Similar results were observed in squid colonized with mixed inocula containing both wild type and the luminescence mutant, where after 15 days the mutant was barely detected. Therefore the decreased persistence observed during early colonization becomes more pronounced as the symbiosis matures, with eventual loss (or near loss) of non-luminescent strains.

One of the most interesting results of this work involved experiments to address the influence of a previous colonization event on recolonization by wild type. For these experiments, juveniles were colonized with either wild type or the luminescence mutant. After one, three, or five days the animals were treated with antibiotics to clear the bacteria from the light organ and then exposed again to wild-type *V. fischeri*. This experimental design allows for testing whether particular strains "signal" to the host their suitability in terms of symbiotic light production and if this influences the maturation of the symbiotic state. If wild-type animals were cured after one day, they were readily recolonized. However, this was not the case if cured after five days. In these animals a refractory state was induced by the wild-type bacteria that prevented recolonization. In contrast, after five days greater than 80% of the animals previously colonized by the luminescence mutant were recolonized by wild type. These results support the idea that the host is detecting light production by bacterial cells and/or is altering physiological conditions to sanction the non-luminescent strains. In addition, the host apparently is able to "eject" an inappropriate light deficient strain, while allowing future recolonization by a symbiotically appropriate light-producing strain.

These studies bring up interesting questions about how the animal senses the light and/or dark bacteria, how the dark strains are selected against, and the nature of the mechanism used to allow recolonization of light organs by luminescent strains after curing of strains unable to produce light. Answers to these questions are actively being pursued, and towards the question of light sensing by the host, several recent studies have identified host cryptochrome and eye-specification genes whose expression appears to be influenced by the light produced by bacteria [@peyer2014, @heath-heckman2013]. However, it is not currently clear how this might be related to selection of light-producing strains. Studies in plant-microbe mutualisms suggest that the host selects cooperative partners through selective resource allocation [@kiers2003, @werner2015]. It remains to be seen whether the squid use a similar strategy. Deciphering the mechanisms hosts use to select microbial partners in diverse systems will be invaluable for increasing our general understanding of the requirements for effective initiation and maintenance of horizontally-transmitted symbioses.

## Nice to meet you... now what is it you do?

The *Vibrio*-squid symbiosis has provided a useful framework for identifying the function of interesting bacterial genes and studying novel genes *in vivo*. Due to the wealth of genetic tools that have been developed for *V. fischeri* and the ability to access the host interface with genetic and imaging tools, it is possible to test the effects of gene loss in the real-world environment of the host. Two examples discussed below are using the *Vibrio*-squid system to broaden understanding of gene function for alternative oxidase (AOX) and for discovering the role of the biofilm inhibitor BinK.

AOX is a terminal respiratory oxidase that is ubiquitous in plants, and is interesting because its activity is not directly linked to generation of the proton motive force [@vanlerberghe1997]. The study of the function of AOX in plants is an active area of research, and AOX function has been linked to both abiotic and biotic stress responses [@vanlerberghe2013]. Only with the explosion of genome and metagenome sequencing was it discovered that certain bacterial genomes also encode this protein [@stenmark2003], and that *aox*-like genes are abundant in metagenomic sequences from ocean surface waters [@mcdonald2005]. However, early progress towards understanding the physiological benefit of AOX function in bacteria was limited by the lack of genetic tools for many of the AOX-encoding organisms. A breakthrough came with the discovery through genome sequencing that *V. fischeri* strain ES114 encoded AOX [@ruby2005]. A transciptomic analysis of the *V. fischeri* response to NO revealed that nitric oxide induces expression of *aox* [@wang2010a]. The connection to NO was further clarified through characterization of the role of the NO-responsive negative regulator NsrR in regulation of *aox* expression, and identification of the ability of *V. fischeri* AOX to function as a NO-resistant oxidase [@dunn2010]. To date, no discernible phenotypic difference between the *aox* mutant and wild type in early colonization of the squid host has been observed. This could be considered surprising because of the known connection between *aox* and NO, and NO and the early stages of host colonization. Although there is the possibility that AOX does not play a role in bacterial physiology during host colonization, an alternative explanation is that the benefit of AOX expression during colonization does not result in a phenotype dramatic enough to be observed in the short time frame of the experiments (1-3 days). Experiments to test this possibility are in progress and would be consistent with studies above described for luminescence mutants in which colonization phenotypes change over the course of symbiosis and effects are magnified when taken out on a multi-week time course.

Interestingly, work with other AOX-containing bacteria suggests that the induction of *aox* expression in response to NO is not unique to *V. fischeri* (A.K. Dunn, unpublished data) and that studying AOX regulation and function in *V. fischeri* may provide insight into how bacteria in ocean surface waters utilize this respiratory pathway in growth and survival. Work is underway to clarify the physiological benefit of AOX function in *V. fischeri*, with the ultimate goal of better understanding how bacteria cope with changing conditions in the environment. Studying AOX in the context of the symbiosis has provided insight into the expression and function of this interesting protein, and provides a framework for broad studies of how AOX function influences bacterial physiology in the environment.

Above we described the key role of biofilm formation in the colonization process as regulated by RscS and Syp. In a recent study the colonization phenotypes of histidine kinase mutants in the *V. fischeri* ES114 genome were examined. For one of the kinases (BinK), the bacteria seemed to colonize substantially better in the absence of the kinase [@brooks2016]. Typical means to predict protein function--e.g., homology, neighboring genes--were not helpful, so phenotypes of cells lacking *binK* were examined in culture and in the host and revealed a substantial increase in symbiotic biofilm formation. BinK--named as the biofilm inhibitor kinase--is therefore a negative regulator of biofilm formation and an additional membrane-bound histidine kinase that is critical for proper regulation of the Syp biofilm.

In the case of both AOX and BinK, the depth of the *V. fischeri*-squid system has provided a means to assign function to novel and poorly-understood proteins. A striking number of gene are poorly understood in bacterial genomes, exemplified by the 149 (32 %) of the minimal 473 genes in the JCVI-syn3.0 genome with functions that remain to be discovered [@hutchinson2016]. The ability to study biological function in the context of the host thus provides a useful context through which to identify and characterize genes and their products.

## Conclusions

The *Vibrio*-squid system has proven to be a useful system for identifying principles of microbe-host interaction, is continuing to serve as a fertile field for discovery, and provides a useful road map for moving from patterns of colonization identification to discerning the molecular communication between microbe and host and underlying those patterns. In our modern era when sequencing data is abundant, it becomes critical to focus questions on important organismal processes and phenotypes. In this manner, the *Vibrio*-squid system provides a long-standing, useful example for how to move from fascinating observations to molecular understanding of the processes by which very different organisms communicate and establish a productive partnership.

Early work in this model system noted that "in nature, organisms often develop normally only in the presence of associated microorganisms," [@mcfall-ngai1991] a key insight that has contributed to the value of a focused model for associations across diverse metazoan hosts.
