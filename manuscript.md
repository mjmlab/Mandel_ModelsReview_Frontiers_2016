Title: Impact and influence of the natural *Vibrio*-squid symbiosis in understanding bacterial-animal interactions  
Date: \today  
...

# Abstract

Animals are colonized by bacteria and in many cases partners have co-evolved to perform mutually beneficial functions. An exciting and ongoing legacy of the past decade has been an expansion of technology to enable study of natural associations *in situ* (*in vivo*). As a result more symbioses are being examined, and additional details are being revealed for well-studied systems. In this context we review literature from the *Vibrio fischeri*-*Euprymna scolopes* symbiosis with a focus on key studies that have had an impact on understanding bacteria-animal interactions broadly. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the system, but rather to focus on particular studies, discuss the general theme of the work beyond one study system, and to highlight connections with other symbiotic systems. Here we discuss how bacteria influence animal development; how microbial developmental biology regulates developmental transitions; the nature of molecular dialogue between bacteria and their animal hosts; how small genetic changes can have large effects on host colonization specificity; and how bacterial metabolism is constrained by the host environment and life cycle.


## What is a model organism?

What makes it valuable?

What does it **model**?

For Vibrio-squid
- reductionist
- genetically-tractable bacterium
- ability to study individual hosts, especially for imaging
- robust natural system -- all animals colonized in 3 hours; enables...
- synchronous colonization. Has been key to understanding developmental processes (aggregation; 12 h signal; etc)

### Bacteria influence animal development

key paper: Montgomery & McFall-Ngai 1994 [@montgomery1994]

connection to other systems:
- Laura Hooper tissue development [@hooper2001a]
- many others...

### Microbial developmental biology is critical for productive interaction with animals

##### Flagellar development

key paper: Ruby and Asato 1993 [@ruby1993]; mechanism (sort-of): [@brennan2013a, @brennan2013, @nikolakakis2016]

##### Aggregation and Biofilm Formation

key paper: Nyholm et al. 2000 [@nyholm2000]; mechanism: [@visick2001, @yip2005, @yip2006]

##### Luminescence

key paper: Visick et al. 2000 [@visick2000a]; follow-up [@bose2008, @koch2013]

(Include quorum sensing??? Should describe historical importance of V. fischeri, but note initial discovery was pre-squid model development??? Don't want to ignore here but it's a bit tangential. Maybe focus on role in the animal.)

### Molecular dialogue between host and bacteria ...

##### Bacterial signals to the host (e.g. peptidoglycan)

key paper: Koropatnick et al. 2004 [@koropatnick2004]

##### Host signals to the bacteria (e.g. nitric oxide, chitin)

key papers: Davidson et al. 2004, Mandel et al. 2012 [@davidson2004, @mandel2012]; follow-up [@wang2010, @wang2010b, @altura2011]


### Small genetic changes can determine host colonization specificity

key paper: Mandel et al. 2009 [@mandel2009]

in contrast to genomic islands; connection to other systems:
- Salmonella Typhimurium / Typhi
- Xenorhabdus [@cowles2008]
- I have lots of other references to add here :)

### Bacterial metabolism is adapted to host constraints

key paper: Dunn et al. 2010 [@dunn2010]; also [@wier2010, @schwartzman2014]

aerobic/anaerobic. Day/night.

make connections to diel/circadian biology
