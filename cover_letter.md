Dear Robert,  

Thank you for your invitation to submit a manuscript for the Frontiers in Microbiology special topic, "Experimental models in animal-associated microbiota," that you are editing with Thomas Bosch and Ute Hentschel. We are submitting a manuscript entitled, "Impact and influence of the natural Vibrio-squid symbiosis in understanding bacterial-animal interactions,‚Äù to be considered for publication as part of the special topic. In the review article, Anne Dunn and I have described key findings in the Vibrio-squid symbiosis through the lens of determining how molecular mechanisms underlie patterns observed in animal-associated microbiota.  

We believe that this work is especially well-suited to the topic on model systems and will be of broad interest to readers of Frontiers in Microbiology. The Vibrio-squid system is a well-studied model, and our review describes some of the hallmarks of the system. Moreover, many articles in Frontiers address emerging model systems, and our article should offer useful commentary as to how to use genetics and complementary approaches to understand molecular communication in those systems. Throughout the article we identify parallels to other beneficial colonization models as well as to pathogenic epithelial colonization.

Thank you for consideration of the enclosed review article.

Regards,
